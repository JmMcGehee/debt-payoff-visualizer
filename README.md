# Debt Payoff Visualizer

Debt Payoff Visualizer is an interactive web app designed to help users create, customize, and visualize their debt repayment journey. By entering all debts and planning extra payments, users can explore different payoff strategies and timelines—from the classic “debt snowball” to prioritizing high-interest accounts or custom orders. The app includes visual charts, drag-and-drop debt ordering, and flexible payment scheduling to empower users to make informed financial decisions.

## Features

- **Easy Data Entry**: Add all debts with details such as category, balance, interest rate, and minimum monthly payment.
- **Custom Payment Strategies**: Set an average extra payment (your “debt snowball”) and adjust payment amounts for specific months.
- **Interactive Timeline**: Visualize projected payoff dates and how long until you’re debt-free.
- **Simulation Playground**: Change extra payment amounts, reorder debts by priority (drag-and-drop), and instantly see the impact on your timeline and interest saved.
- **Flexible Debt Order**: Try classic strategies (smallest balance, highest interest) or customize the payoff order yourself.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile.
- **Export Options** (planned): Save or share your debt payoff plan.
